                <p>Although I formally began my path toward web development later in life in 2018, I spent my teenage years expressing my creativity through HTML blog layouts and forums. I enjoyed tinkering with websites and creating something that reflected my personality and allowed me to showcase my passions. HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery are quickly becoming good friends, and I am learning and growing exponentially.</p>
                <p>Never one to let pain darken my mood, I aim to brighten workplaces with smiles. I am someone who is caring and will stop at nothing to accomplish her goals. I leverage my passion for the English language, editing, and writing to help create dynamic and well-designed user interfaces. I enjoy working with the front end and creating well-crafted web applications.</p>

                <p>Born and raised a Texan, I attended the University of North Texas and graduated with a degree in English Literature in 2009. Earlier that year I married my husband, who I met on an online video game. In summer of 2016 I relocated to the Twin Cities area with my husband, our two dogs, and two cats. Although I became ill in 2010, I was finally cleared for brain surgery with the Mayo Clinic in November of 2016 which greatly improved my quality of life.</p>
                <p>I have long been a connoisseur of the greater nerd arts: science, books, comics, video games, and astronomy. If it's nerdy, odds are I adore it. I've recently started crafting felt flowers for my goddaughter and have enjoyed making friends replicas of popular video game flowers. Animals have also been a lifelong interest of mine. I spent my childhood charming my parents into taking home stray animals, and my adulthood rescuing as many critters as my husband will allow. If I could talk my husband into it, we'd have a farm filled with rescued animals, including some scaly and slithery residents.</p>
